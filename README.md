#Console-based-Text-Editor
Final project for ICS 45C. Follows Professor Thornton's code template for the text editor. 

My responsibility for this project was to implement the logic and interactivity behind the console text editor. This was done through modular object-oriented practices towards reusability.

The text editor supported basic functionality including text insertion, deletion, undo, redo through polymorphism. 

Cursor movement was implemented with the ncurses programming library.
